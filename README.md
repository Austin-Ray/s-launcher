## What is S Launcher

S Launcher is a small, minimalist launcher focused on being the launching point
to every part of your phone. It was started as a way to refamiliarize myself
with Android development, to learn a launchers importance to the Android
experience, and as bet with my friend,
[Andrew](https://github.com/andrewgevans95). As part of the process, I cannot
use any other launcher, which forces  me to address any issues or missing
features. While intended for personal use, feel free to try it out!
